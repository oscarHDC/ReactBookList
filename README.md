This is my very first written code with react, nothing interesting to see here. In this little project I have learned a bunch of things

    - React Fundamentals 
    - Setting-up react project
    - JSX
    - Props, lists and keys
    - React components
    - Handling events with components
    - Import & export techniques
    - VSCode tools and plugins to improve the workflow.
    - CSS files
    
I am really enjoying learning this new library, it has uncountables features, there is a lot to learn.
