This is my very first written code with react, nothing interesting to see here. In this little project I have learned the basics of React, how to set-up a React project, sintax of JSX, props, props lists, React components, CSS files, VSCode tools and plugins to improve the workflow. I am really enjoying learning this new library, it has uncountables features, there is a lot to learn
